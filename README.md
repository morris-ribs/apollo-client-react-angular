# apollo-client-react-angular

Examples of apps using Apollo, in Angular and React

# Goal

The goal of this repository is to show how to use Apollo Client for GraphQL in React and Angular 2, for queries and mutations.

The app will consist of displaying a list of music albums - retrieved from a server using GraphQL standards - with a possibility to add new ones.

The way of working is exactly the same in both client solutions.
