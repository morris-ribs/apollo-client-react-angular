# React Examples

In this directory I present you two versions of the client app developed in React.

**basic_from_scratch** is the version I have done by myself, just running a npm init in order to generate the package.json and building everything

**redux-graphql-materialui** is the solution done using **Yeoman** and **Electrode** to scaffold the application.
