# React Example

This is the basic React Example (without Electrode).

In order to run this example, open a terminal and browse to the root folder of the solution.

```sh
# `cd` to project directory
$ cd <project_dir>

# install all dependencies
$ npm install
```

Then, start the app with the following command.

```sh
# run the client app
$ npm start
```

Finally, you can browse to `http:// localhost:8900/` to check the final rendering.
